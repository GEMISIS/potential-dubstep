Purpose of project:
1. To create an open source Landsat 7/8 grid aligned database which requires no additional processing beyond the original USGS surface reflectance product.
2. To create a fast and extensible REST api web service to allow clients to communicate and request product data.
3. To create a well documented framework for grid aligning Landsat 7/8 surface reflectance products to all for learning and improvement by the open source community.
